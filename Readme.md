Used as a practice for knex migrations, conncetion, and seeds.

### Run Code

```
node index.js
```

### Descriptionn

The code is built with Node framework Express. And uses knexjs for DB

`index.js`
lists 3 APIs and host the app listening on port 3000.

- GET '/': Prints 'Hello World'
- GET '/user': List all user from database
- POST 'user': Add new user to database

`db/knexfile.js`
contains all DB connection configurations.

`db/xxx.sqlite3`
is a local file that acts as a DataBase. Can be viewed using sqlite Viewer.
(So the connection is configured to sqlite3 client in db/knexfile.js)

`db/migrations/`
stores the historic knex migration files that set up tables for a DB.
It's useful for understanding the tables, DB changes over time during the application development.
It's auto generated by `knex migrate:make <name> --knexfile db/knexfile.js>`.

`db/seeds/`
contains the seed files.
It's auto generated by `knex seed:make <name> --knexfile db/knexfile.js>`.
Run `knex seed:run --env <env> --knexfile db/knexfile.js` will run all the seed files and fill in data.
